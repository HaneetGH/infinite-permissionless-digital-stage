# Future Roadmap

This section explains some areas where this platform could be upgraded.

## Outsource your Transcoding to Livepeer

Livepeer is an protocol providing pay-as-you-go Open-Source Video Infrastructure Services using Ethereum for payment clearing.

Livepeer's protocol and cryptocurrency govern a transcoding marketplace where broadcasters can buy and sell transcoding services from GPU Miners in exchange for Ethereum crypto currency.

This section will explain how to configure your Permissionless Digital Stage to use these services.

## Deploying on a Raspberry Pi

The binaries from Livepeer releases are compiled for a x86 chipset.

We would need to compile some binaries for the RPi, but otherwise everything else should be the same.

## Configuring for IPV6

All contributions welcome!

## Access Control

Currently, any client which has access to the server can stream into it or out of it.

This topic is to investigate how to set up MVP access control.

## Distribute transcoding to host with GPU

If you have GPUs available, you can configure your transcoder process to use these.

## Mobile App

- MVP: 1) tap launcher to turn on channel, 2. tap screen to turn off channel

- Extra - integrate with payment channels for paying for content
